# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning (R)
The aim of this project is to utilise Machine Learning to analyse the [customer-personality.csv](https://github.com/ngyiling/customer-segmentation-ML/blob/main/customer-personality.csv) dataset to understand customer behaviours and purchasing patterns. 

<br />

**Technology:** dplyr, Hmisc, ggplot2, ggfortify 

<br />

**Results:** 
- Utilised RFM analysis to analyse customer engagement in the store. 
- Conducted dimension reduction with Factor Analysis to understand the correlations among the 20 variables.
- Conducted dimension reduction with principal components analysis, to reduce collinearity, followed by k-means clustering, which groups customers into different clusters where each cluster represents a segment that shares similar characteristics.
